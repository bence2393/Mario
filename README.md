# Mario

Console platform game written in C#. Move with the left and right arrow keys and press space to jump. Collect the `*` coins scattered in the level.

## Running

dotnet build MarioGame
dotnet run --project MarioGame
```

The console displays colored blocks where `#` marks the ground and `*` are coins. The player is shown as a red `M`. Your current coin count is printed below the level.
